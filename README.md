# Starbucks Data Offers Analysis

This project is a data analysis on simulated information provided by Startbucks that contains data about their program of offers. This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.

Some of the questions to answer are:

1. Which offers are the most popular
2. What offers prefer more ever gender
3. How much in average a person a customer spend in any time since the star of the offer.
4. How BOGO and discount offer generate transactions to Starbucks? Which type is the best?
5. Who of the customers makes more income per year? are they the same that spend more in Starbucks?
6. Can we find some interesting relations between the numerical features?

In the jupyter notebook you will find all the process made to clean the data and obtain the different figures and tables to have a better understanding of the data.

There is a interesting blog post about this project with results and conclusions in [Medium](https://medium.com/@pdro07/coffee-data-61cd186cee4c?sk=19182e5804ca3fd5173345d23c5969c0)
